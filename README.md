# Shopping List

Hosted at: https://shoppinglist-soc.netlify.com/

This was my first full React project that I made as part of School of Code. Through making this, I cemented my understanding of React and JSX, how components work, useState, making a custom hook, and storing information in localStorage. It's not perfect, and of course with hindsight, there are a few things I'd do differently now that I have more practice with React, but nevertheless, I'm really proud of it because it opened the door for all my subsequent React adventures!

## To run:

- npm start (created with create-react-app)
